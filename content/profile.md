Hi 👋, I’m **Tim Jones**, a Belfast-based Cloud, DevOps & DevSecOps Consultant with a PhD in Computer Vision and a long-standing fascination with emerging technology.  I've been around the block in work at this point so I am in an architecture role, and although I love the big-picture perspective and solving real-world business problems, I'm also a proud nerd at the core.

## ☀️ By Day...

- **Cloud & DevSecOps Strategy**  
  Helping organisations align tech goals with business objectives, and building security into their pipelines from day one.

- **Enterprise Architecture**  
  Designing secure, scalable systems—often at the edge of legacy and modern stack integration.

- **Kubernetes Native Engineering**  
  From Anthos to Operator SDK, I’m at home in the K8s ecosystem and simply *love* Golang!

- **Security-First Design**  
  Backed by CISSP and CCSP certifications, I build solutions that don’t just work, but work securely.

## 🌖 By Night...

- **AI Research**  
  I can't help but be fascinated by the emergy world of agentic AI, so I spend a surprising amount of time tinking with how to apply it to use-cases such as cloud security.

- **Crypto Trading**  
  Unlike traditional capital markets, the crypto markets are far more accessible to the average nerd like myself, and there also open 24/7... 😏

- **3D Printing**  
  Thats right, I really did print a printer... Twice.  Also useful for random brackets and toys for the kids(/me).
