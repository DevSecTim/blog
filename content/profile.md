Hi 👋, I’m **Tim**—a Belfast-based IT Consultant with a PhD in Computer Vision and a lifelong passion for emerging technology. These days, I work in architecture, where I thrive on solving real-world business problems and shaping the big picture. But at heart, I’m still an engineer: hands-on, curious, and always building something new.

## ☀️ By Day

- **Solution & Enterprise Architecture**  
  Designing secure, scalable systems—often at the edge of legacy and modern stack integration. I pride myself on my ability to truly understand the architectural culture and motivations of my clients.

- **Cloud, DevOps & DevSecOps Strategy**  
  My primary purpose is to help organisations align tech goals with business objectives, and building security into their pipelines and workflows from day one.

- **Security-First Design**  
  Backed by CISSP and CCSP certifications, I understand the importance of process and discipline when it comes to technology solutions and governance.

- **AI Engineering**  
  I build practical, secure AI systems that bridge the gap between DevOps, cloud, and real-world business needs.

## 🌖 By Night

- **Investing & Capital Markets**  
  I enjoy trying out on all things investment, stocks and shares, ISAs, ETFs and so on - I have been known to say "buy the dip and HODL" as if I know what I'm doing on occasion (I don't).

- **Crypto Trading**  
  Unlike traditional capital markets, the crypto markets are far more accessible to the average finance nerd like myself, and there also open 24/7... 😏

- **Technology Research**  
  I’m fascinated by how technologies like agentic AI are reshaping software, security, and business—and I’m always experimenting, learning, and sharing what I find.

- **3D Printing**  
  Thats right, I really did print a printer... Twice.  Also useful for random brackets and toys for the kids(/me).
